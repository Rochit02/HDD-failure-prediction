# HDD Failure Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hard disk drive (HDD) failures across multiple quarters starting from 2020.  
The goal is to compile and study HDD failure data to identify patterns, trends, and potential causes.

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
- âœ… Segregated **failure rows** of HDDs from each individual quarter since 2020.
- âœ… Created a **combined failure CSV file** from all quarterly datasets.
- âœ… Generated a **count of HDD models** that experienced failures.

## ðŸ—‚ Files in Project
- `failures QX YYYY.csv` â†’ Quarterly HDD failure datasets (original data).
- `combined_failures.csv` â†’ Consolidated dataset of all failure records.
- `model_counts.txt` â†’ List of HDD models and their respective failure counts.
- `p2.py` â†’ Python script for merging and counting failures.

## ðŸ“ˆ HDD Failure Counts by Model
Below is the failure count per HDD model from the combined dataset:
